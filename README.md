# AWS Cloud Security Monitoring Demo

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a cloud-native security monitoring pipeline in AWS.

The objective is to centralize logging, detect suspicious activity, trigger alerts, and document an investigation workflow — simulating real-world SOC and Cloud Security operations.

## Technologies Used
- AWS CloudTrail (API activity logging)
- Amazon CloudWatch Logs
- CloudWatch Metric Filters & Alarms
- Amazon SNS (Email alerting)
- Amazon GuardDuty (Threat detection)
- AWS Security Hub (Findings aggregation)

---

## Project Goals
- Establish secure IAM baseline
- Enable centralized logging
- Detect failed console login attempts
- Detect IAM privilege escalation
- Simulate security incidents
- Implement alerting pipeline
- Document investigation process
