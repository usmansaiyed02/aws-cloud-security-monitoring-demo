# CloudTrail Setup

## Objective
Enable centralized control-plane logging for auditability and real-time monitoring.

## Configuration
- Trail name: `security-monitoring-trail`
- Scope: Multi-region
- Events: Management events (Read + Write)
- Data events: Disabled (cost control)
- Insights: Disabled (cost control)
- Log file validation: Enabled
- Destinations:
  - S3 log archive (long-term retention)
  - CloudWatch Logs log group: `/aws/cloudtrail/security-monitoring`

## Validation
- Confirmed CloudTrail status: Logging ON
- Confirmed CloudWatch log streams created and JSON events visible
- Confirmed events generated by console/API activity

## Why This Matters
CloudTrail provides the authoritative record of AWS API activity. CloudWatch integration enables near real-time detection and alerting for security events.
